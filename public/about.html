<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a marketing graduate, my professional journey unexpectedly led me into the exciting world of events, a path I've
  come to deeply embrace. What brings me the most joy is the direct interaction with clients, navigating their needs, 
  and curating experiences that leave a lasting impact. While I'm more accustomed to organizing corporate events, I'm 
  equally comfortable planning personal ones. In addition to my expertise in event management, I'm also a travel consultant
  specializing in tailor-made VIP trips in Portugal.</p>

<p>Now, fueled by a desire for new horizons, I am eagerly looking forward to advancing my career beyond the borders of Portugal.
  In 2025, I will be moving to Dublin, seeking a vibrant international setting where I can not only contribute my skills but also 
  continue to learn, evolve, and cultivate meaningful connections in a dynamic professional environment. As part of my commitment
  to continuous growth, I am also pursuing a full-stack certification to broaden my technical expertise and enhance my professional versatility.</p>

<p>Being the older sister of two young ladies has greatly shaped my organizational skills, patience, and leadership qualities.
  Balancing responsibilities and serving as a role model for my sisters has taught me the importance of adaptability, empathy, and effective
  communicationâ€”qualities that I bring into my professional life..</p>
